# individual-project-kapilgeet123

## Problem Statement
We have to make cart validation system . Input will be give a database file , input order file and card file path. We have to maintain a static database and design an application using design pattern. We have to parse the input file and generate the total bill amount. We also have to take into account about the cap on each category as well as the database quantity. Output the file with final amount to be paid.

## Instructions to run the application:

Needs Java 8 installed in the system that is running the program.

### Instructions to run the JAR file:
- Open Command Prompt in the location of JAR File. <br>(Location of JAR File is: `<Present Directory>\out\artifacts\individual_project_kapilgeet123_jar\individual-project-kapilgeet123.jar)`. 
- Run the following command in the command prompt:
`java -jar <jar_name> "<Dataset File Path>" "<Card  File Path>" "<Input Order  File Path>"` <br>
For Example: <br>
`java -jar individual-project-kapilgeet123.jar "<Dataset File Path>" "<Card Information File Path>" "<Input Order Information File Path>"`
- Output files will be created in the directory as the files provided as arguments to run the JAR. 
for ex: The aguments to the file would look like 
C:\...(Datasetpath)
C:\.. (Cardfile)
C:\..(finaloutputfile)
## Design Patterns:
-Iterator
-Singleton
-Factory
